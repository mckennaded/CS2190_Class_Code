# Why I Chose React
I chose React for this project because it is one of the most popular frameworks that I have worked with previosuly. 

# Difficulties Encountered and How I Overcame Them
One of the main difficulties I faced was setting up the project environment. I initially ran into issues with missing dependencies and incorrect versions, which caused errors like react-scripts: command not found. I resolved this by starting from scratch with npx create-react-app, which ensured all dependencies were installed correctly. 

# What I Enjoyed About Using React
I enjoyed how React's component system allowed me to break down the TODO app into smaller, manageable pieces. The ability to see changes instantly in the browser made it easier to see errors in my code.

# What I Disliked
One downside I noticed was the initial setup complexity, especially when dealing with dependency issues.

# Something Entertaining
While working on this project, I created to do's for this project.
